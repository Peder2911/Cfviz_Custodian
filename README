A script to push data to a PostgreSQL server

Keeps all data files in /var/data synchronized to a Postgres database.

Optionally transforms data before adding it to the database, using a batch
script in /var/transform. 

Data is transformed according to the "class" of the data, The class is defined
as the first "word" in the filename.  For example, cf_3_3 is of class "cf", and
will be transformed by the "cf" script under /var/transform.

The env variable INTERVAL dictates how often the script will check
for changes in the file timestamps.

Run with TESTING env set to connect to the test.sqlite file instead of trying
to reach database:5432.  This is useful for creating test-databases for the
apps. This also changes the folder being synched to ./data and the script
folder to ./scripts.
