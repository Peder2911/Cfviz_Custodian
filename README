A script to push data to a PostgreSQL server

Keeps all data files in /var/data synchronized to a Postgres database.

Optionally transforms data before adding it to the database, using a batch
script in /var/transform. 

Data is transformed according to the "class" of the data, The class is defined
as the first "word" in the filename.  For example, cf_3_3 is of class "cf", and
will be transformed by the "cf" script under /var/transform.

The env variable INTERVAL dictates how often the script will check
for changes in the file timestamps.

Run with DEBUG set in env to connect to a database on localhost, instead of
trying to reach the "database"-database (which works well in docker).
